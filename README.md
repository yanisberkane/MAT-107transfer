# Mathematics - 107transfer Project
Language: Python

A program that optimizes the transfer function computations.
A transfer function is defined by two strings (one for the numerator, one for the denominator), composed by the polynomial coefficients split by the ‘*’ sign.

For instance, “1*4*2*6*0*8” stands for:

Your program has to print the frequency responses of the component for a every values in a range from 0 to 1, with a step of 0.001.
